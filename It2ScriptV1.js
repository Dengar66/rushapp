main.textViews()["What is recruitment?\nFraternity recruitment takes place the first three weeks of the fall and spring semesters. Through a wide variety of events, chapters will share the meaning of their brotherhood. Recruitment is also an opportunity for the chapter members to get to know the potential member and for the potential member to get to know them. It is a relaxed setting for the potential member to meet as many chapters and chapter members as possible and to ask whatever questions the potential member feels pertinent, such as finance, scholarship, activities, housing, and time commitment. Most importantly, the potential member should look for a chapter where he feels comfortable with the men. \n\nWhich fraternity is right for me?\nThe only way to know which chapter you feel truly welcome in is to see as many as possible. We encourage potential recruits to visit every chapter, because you never know how much it may appeal to you until you meet the members. Take advantage of the recruitment period and see several chapters, you may find yourself at a fraternity you never thought you’d be at and love it!\n\nHow do I join after recruitment? \nAfter recruitment is about two-thirds over, chapters will begin to give out \"bids\". Bids are an invitation to join a fraternity as a pledge/new member. Once you have signed a bid, you've committed to pledging that house, you cannot sign another bid until being released from the first. \n\nWhat happens after I sign my bid?\nOnce you have decided on a fraternity, and have signed your bid, you become a pledge/new member of that chapter. Pledging is a period where you will learn about your fraternity's history and rituals. Some national fraternities do not have such a period, so we encourage you to ask members more information on the chapter's education processes.\n\nHow much does a fraternity cost?\nThe cost of dues and living in a chapter house vary by chapter. Dues are used to pay for insurance and social events, to assist with philanthropic events and community service projects, etc. The cost of living in a fraternity house varies die to house size, amenities, and meal plans. For the 2014 calendar year, the costs were as follows:\n\nSpring 2014:\nLowest - $70\nHighest - $699\nAverage - $399\n\nFall 2014:\nLowest - $70\nHighest - $900\nAverage - $455\n\nRoom and Board (semester):\nLowest - $1,750\nHighest - $6,000\nAverage - $3,255\n\n\n\nWhat if I don't receive a bid from the fraternity I want to join?\nMost likely the brothers of the fraternity don’t know you well enough at that point, and the best solution to this problem is to continue attending recruitment events. Usually bids are given throughout the last week of recruitment. So if yours didn't come the first night, it will probably be forthcoming. However, this is also a good opportunity to go and check out some other fraternities around campus, and see what they have to offer. \n\nAbove all, we want you to have a good time during recruitment, so take advantage of all it has to offer. Remember that joining a fraternity is a big decision; so make sure that you feel comfortable about where you choose to go. All the fraternities on campus have lots to offer, so wherever you end up, we’re sure you’ll have a blast.\n"].dragInsideWithOptions({startOffset:{x:0.39, y:0.20}, endOffset:{x:0.55, y:0.53}});
